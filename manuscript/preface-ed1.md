# Preface (1st edition)

In November 2014, I organised a 3-week workshop at the Thoughtworks Xi'an office called *3 Pages in 3 Weeks*. Participants were asked to implement a web page using HTML/CSS in each session.

The workshop was a bit like a drawinging class, where everyone worked from a mockup (usually from a professional designer) like a landing page or product detail page and implemented it in HTML/CSS.

The participants were mixed with front-end developers, back-end developers, test engineers, UX designers, business analysts and recruiters. Most participants have had some prior exposure to CSS, but not to the point of proficiency; a small number of participants have no experience to web design/development at all, and the rest of them are specialised in web design/development.

In the workshop, I covered the basics of using the new HTML5 tags for more semantic documents and the new CSS3 features like shadows, animations, rounded corners, etc. In the second half of each session, there was a showcase where they could share their work and get feedback from others and the instructor (me). After the showcase, I demonstrated how to implement a small part of the page to help those participants who did not have a lot of basic knowledge.

As a result, the workshop was very well received, and participants put in a lot of efforts to complete the 'homework'. By the end of the three weeks, the majority achieved a solid foundation of HTML/CSS and could implement a working page from any given mockup. And according to the results of a post-course survey, most of them enjoyed the content as well as how it was delivered.

One day after the workshop, I realised that this might be a good topic that could easily be crystallised for others who had not attended the workshop. So I decided to put it all together and create a book, saving me the trouble of going over and over the lectures myself.

## Some updates

*3 Pages in 3 Weeks* has received a surprising amount of support since it was posted on GitBook, from both my colleagues and the community. A lot of my colleagues at Thoughtworks have helped me to actively promote the book after its release, which has resulted in the book getting more attention, and I would like to thank them for that as well.
