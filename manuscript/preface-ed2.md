# Preface (2nd edition)

Somehow eight years have passed since I wrote the first edition of `3 Pages in 3 Weeks`. Eight years is a considerablely long time in an era of rapid front-end technology development. Eight years ago, Internet Explorer was still popular, `flex` layout would not be adopted on most projects due to compatibility, and CSS variables were treated as a radical technology. Eight years ago, `float` layouts were a necessary skill for most advanced layouts, and to set up live refresh during development, developers had to do a lot of configuration locally.

While occasionally going through my mailbox recently, I realised it had been a long time since I updated this booklet. When I opened it up, I was surprised to find that much of it was completely outdated. Such as the fact that `float`, which was the defacto of complicated layout back then, is almost completely gone in the real world. `flex` and even `grid` layouts can easily be implemented in ways that developers hadn't even thought of before. And launching a live server in Visual Studio Code takes only a few seconds, not to mention that all modern browsers shipped with fancy DevTools that support all kinds of debugging and editing.

## Structure of the book

Similar to the first edition, the book is divided into three main chapters. In fact, it is a process of implementing different styles of design, three projects in three weeks time.

The first chapter is about a typical landing page. It includes a navigation bar, a hero banner and a news list. Here we go through some environment setup, including the configuration of the tools and explanation of the basics. By the end of the first chapter, you will have learned how to deconstruct a design, write the corresponding HTML, and implement common layouts through `flex` layouts. Also you will be able to publish your website to the public and allow your friends or colleagues to access it.

Chapter two is a conceptual design for `Instagram`. It includes a vertical navigation bar, card design and more complex typography and layout. We will explore more about `flex` layout and `grid` layout. In addition, we will learn about the use of font icons and the priority of selectors in CSS.

Chapter three is a page with a responsive design. We will complete the interface on the small screen with a mobile-first strategy first, and then overrides styles to adapting to desktop version through media queries. In the process, we'll learn how to simplify HTML writing using `Emmet`, use CSS variables to eliminate duplicate code and much more. At the end of the project, we will also learn some foundamental design principles so that you can be more confident about how to implement a page on your own without a mockup.

## Style changes of new edition

The first edition had two projects plus a hands-on (build-your-own) practice. The new edition has been modified to three different projects, placing the exercises section at the end of each chapter. Regarding the distribution of knowledge, the new edition is more evenly distributed to ensure that each chapter covers some important points.

In addition, when re-reading the first edition, I found many incorrect assumptions about beginners' knowledge. Many concepts unfamiliar to beginners were not explained enough, as well as problems such as the slightly large amount of code.

In rewriting it, I tried to add as much background knowledge as possible to make each step easier for starters.

I hope you can enjoy the new edition just as you did for the first one.
